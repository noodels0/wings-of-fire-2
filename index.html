        <h1>About </h1>
        <p>
            Books 1-5: The dragons of Pyrrhia are divided, and only the five dragonets of destiny foretold in a mysterious NightWing prophecy can unite the seven warring tribes in order to bring peace and prosperity to their world.

            Books 6-10: The dragons of Pyrrhia are at peace after the great war, but a new prophecy has arisen, and those destined to fulfill it are the young dragons of the Jade Winglet: Kinkajou, Moonwatcher, Peril, Qibli, Turtle, and Winter. They keep a wary eye out for dragons with dark intentions such as Chameleon, Darkstalker, and Onyx. This small band of dragonets must fulfill their own prophecy — to find the "Lost City of Night" and stop the ominous "thunder and ice" from destroying Jade Mountain!

            Books 11-15: On Pantala, turmoil is brewing. The devastating Tree Wars have left the LeafWings near extinction and the SilkWings to live as subservient, second-class dragons under Queen Wasp and her HiveWing subjects. Fifty years later, young SilkWing Blue's peaceful life is turned upside-down when his sister Luna is stolen away by the HiveWings after undergoing her Metamorphosis. As Blue, Swordtail, and unlikely allies discover more about Pantala's seemingly balanced way of life, they embark on a harrowing journey in hopes of defeating an evil regime. Will they succeed, and free Pantala from Queen Wasp's cruel wrath? Or will they fail, and lose any hope of freedom?

            <h2>The Author</h2>

            <p>I was born July 31 in Caracas, Venezuela, and lived in Asuncion, Paraguay; Miami, Florida; and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, before moving to New Jersey in high school, where I started doing theatre—mostly backstage work, because it was artistically fulfilling.


                I graduated from Williams College in 1998 and I currently live in Boston with my husband, my two hilarious children, an alarmingly funny ever-increasing number of snails, and our fluffball who finds us all terribly boring, Rainbow Dog (we call him Bo for short).
